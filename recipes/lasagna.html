    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add onions and garlic, and cook until onions are transparent. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, salt, and oregano, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious lasagna!</li>
